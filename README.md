# Dev-Deals App

## Description
A small project attempting to simulate a supermarket noticeboard with a dash of the cheek of Vic Deals.

By the end of day we hope to have a "/" for adding and showing all bulletins and an "/:id" which will include our update & delete functionality. 

## Scope

Our requirements are to include 1x thunk and to focus on the team dynamics over the product. Our self imposed requirement is to have fun!

## MVP

Our MVP Includes one thunk when retrieving and loading bulletins. We would like to have full CRUD functionality. 

## Stretch
Our stretch includes fun loading screens (more thunks) and to list fellow student's as well as facilitator's property in the L&F or B,S&E. 

We would also like to remove the delete funcionality in favour of a timer delete functionality - more like a supermarket noticeboard.
